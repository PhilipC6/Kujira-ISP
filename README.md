# Kujira Vision Statement
We plan to make a game using Godot where the player drags and drops different fish into a zone/pit. Whenever two fish of the same type make contact, they merge into next fish in the chain, until the player eventually reaches the largest fish, a whale. If a fish remains above the top line of the pit for five seconds, it will result in a game over. The goal of the game is to merge two whales together while achieving the highest possible score. After the game is over, the player will be provided with a retry button to restart the game.
