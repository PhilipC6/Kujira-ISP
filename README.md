# Kujira Vision Statement
We plan to make a game using Godot where the player drags and drops different fish into a zone/pit. Whenever two fish of the same type make contact, they merge into next fish in the chain, until the player eventually reaches the largest fish, a whale. If a fish remains above the top line of the pit for five seconds, it will result in a game over. The goal of the game is to merge two whales together while achieving the highest possible score. The score is determined by how many fish are merged, with larger fish adding more to the score. After the game is over, the player will be provided with a retry button to restart the game.
