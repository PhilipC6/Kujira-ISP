# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 - Purpose
This SRS document is meant to outline the features and expectations for the Kujira game for our ISP. This document serves as a reference for how the end product is expected to look like and function.

### 1.2 - Scope of Project
The Kujira game will be a version of the existing Suika game. The expectation is that this game will serve as a source of entertainment and relaxation for users.

# 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 - Product Perspective
The Kujira game will function similarly to the Suika game, in which the playerâ€™s only controls are to drag the fruit and drop it in the selected spot. The fruit the player drops is randomly generated from a list of fruits. The objective of the game is to get the highest score possible by merging fruits of the same type together to create bigger ones. However, instead of fruits, the Kujira game will offer different types of fish.

### 2.2 - User Class
Player: The player will use keyboard controls to move the fish. The left key will move the fish left. The right key will move the fish right. The spacebar will drop the fish. Upon game over, the player will have the option to restart by clicking on the given button with a mouse.

### 2.3 - Operating Environment
The game will be hosted on a specific website for this project. The game will be compatible with Google Chrome.

### 2.4 - Constraints
Players will only be able to play if they have access to a mouse and keyboard.
