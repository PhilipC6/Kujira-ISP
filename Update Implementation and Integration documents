Integration Test Plan
part 1. development
to develop the Kujira game we first need everyone to be able to use and access the swift software
and we are going to be using the big bang method which involes integrating all the compinetns at once and testing them as a complete system
part 2. Unit testing 
once we start coding we should conitusly check small isolated parts in our code to see theres no errors in our code and it works
part 3. system intergreation testing
Continusoly checking our code as a whole to make sure theres no errors in our code and it works

coding stanards and guidelines
-reusabilty 
 Identify common functionality that can be reused across components. Create libraries, helpers, utilities etc.
-security
Incorporate security best practices around data validation, sanitization, encryption
-testing
 Write unit tests covering key functions and modules. Perform integration testing between components.

Version Control (e.g., Git) Guidelines
-Run tests before push  
Ensure all unit and integration tests pass locally before pushing commits.
-Use feature/topic branching
 Create separate branches for each new feature or piece of work to isolate changes.

release notes
-Summarize release goals
Outline the major features, enhancements, or issues targeted in the release.
-List bug fixes
Identify and describe any bugs or defects that were fixed.

Deployment Instructions
-trouble shooting
